This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
Hi! I’m Oluwapelumi, a software engineering student passionate about learning how to create things with code. I’m just beginning my journey, and so far, I’ve been working with programming languages like Python, Java, and HTML/CSS.

Right now, I’m focusing on learning the fundamentals of web development and algorithms, and I’m eager to explore areas like mobile app development and machine learning.

I’m using GitHub to practice what I’m learning, build small projects, and track my progress. As I grow, I hope to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with others in the community.

Feel free to check out my repositories or reach out if you’re also starting out – let’s learn together!
